# Network Traffic and Malware Analysis

This project provides a structured approach to analyzing network traffic and identifying potential malware or suspicious activities using tools like Wireshark, VirusTotal, CloudShark, Hybrid Analysis, and intrusion detection systems such as Snort and Suricata.


## 1. Initial Examination with Wireshark
The first step in the analysis process involves examining a PCAP file using Wireshark:

Filter on http.request:

Identifies the IP address of the infected host.
Provides a general timeline for the suspicious activity.
Example: In a sample PCAP starting at 2017-01-27 22:53 UTC, infection traffic begins shortly after. Filtering on http.request reveals that all source IP addresses point to 172.16.4.193.

Determine Host Name and MAC Address:
Use NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) traffic for host name resolution.
Inspect DHCP traffic to extract both host name and MAC address for additional context

## 2. VirusTotal Integration
Use VirusTotal to analyze suspicious files, domains, IPs, and URLs. This tool provides a robust way to detect malware, phishing attempts, and other breaches. Results are automatically shared with the security community to enhance global threat intelligence and response capabilities.

## 3. File Analysis Using Snort and Suricata alerts
Leverage the capabilities of Snort and Suricata to investigate file details and detect potential intrusions or malicious payloads. These alerts offer insights into anomalies in network traffic, providing a clearer picture of the potential threat.

## 4. CloudShark for Threat Assessment
CloudShark is used for in-depth packet analysis.

Threat Assessment Summary:

Begin with an overview of potential risks.

Advanced Analysis:

Check threat vectors such as ransomware activity or onion domain lookups (e.g., "Cerber").

Identify network trojans and flag potentially malicious traffic.
DNS Activity Analysis Tool: Examine DNS query logs for suspicious patterns. Select specific queries for detailed inspection to uncover anomalies.

## 5. Hybrid Analysis for URL and File Investigation
Integrate Hybrid Analysis to gather detailed behavioral insights about files and URLs. This tool helps detect malicious activities, such as file drops, command and control (C2) communications, and other indicators of compromise (IoCs). The results are essential for understanding and mitigating threats effectively.
